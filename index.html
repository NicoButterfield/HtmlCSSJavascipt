                        HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages.
                        It is one of the most basic building blocks of every website, so it's crucial to learn if you want to have a career in web development. 
                        This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.
