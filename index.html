                            HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages.
                            It is one of the most basic building blocks of every website, so it's crucial to learn if you want to have a career in web development. 
                            This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.

                            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to add style to a web page by dictating how a site is displayed on a browser. CSS is unique in that it doesn't create any new elements, like HTML or JavaScript. Instead, it's a language used to style HTML elements.
                            CSS is responsible for the text style, size, positioning, color, and more on a website. It's also what controls how a website's style shifts between desktop and mobile versions. Without CSS, websites would look pretty boring.

                                <li class = "item">Efficient: only a few lines of code are required to dictate the style on a webpage, which speeds up loading time and keeps files relatively lightweight. </li>

                                JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement special features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.
                                Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things on the web. Any time you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a page, and dynamically changing element colors on a page, to name a few features, you're seeing the effects of JavaScript.
